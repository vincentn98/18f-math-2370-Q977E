# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll implement Euclidean division (see `wex/150`).


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [euclid_2](+euclid_2)
1. [euclid_2_down](+euclid_2_down)
1. [euclid_2_up](+euclid_2_up)
