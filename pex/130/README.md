# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll implement Euclidean division in two ways (see `wex/130`).


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [euclid_F](+euclid_F)
1. [euclid_G](+euclid_G)
1. [euclid_G_hat](+euclid_G_hat)
