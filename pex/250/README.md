# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll implement more efficient versions of XGCD, determine if two naturals are coprime, and calculate modular multiplicative inverses.


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [coprime](+coprime)
1. [mod_mult_inv](+mod_mult_inv)
1. [xgcd_tail](+xgcd_tail)
1. [xgcd_while](+xgcd_while)
