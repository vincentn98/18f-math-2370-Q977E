# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll implement:

1. `mult_N_R_2_tail`: a tail-recursive version of the original `mult_N_R_2`.
1. `mult_N_R_2_while`: a `while`-loop version of the original `mult_N_R_2`.


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [mult_N_R_2_tail](+mult_N_R_2_tail)
1. [mult_N_R_2_while](+mult_N_R_2_while)
