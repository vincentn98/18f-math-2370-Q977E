# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll define the `mult_N_R` and `pow_N_R` functions first discussed in `lecture/01`.
You'll need to implement `isN` and `isR` from `pex/lib` prior to this PEX.
You'll also need to use `assert` to detect and create exceptions, first introduced in `lecture/03`.


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [mult_N_R](+mult_N_R)
1. [pow_N_R](+pow_N_R)
