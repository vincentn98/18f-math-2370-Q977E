# Programming Exercises

Most programming exercises are in directories named like `XXY`, where `XX` is the lecture number and `Y` is a number.
The following table of examples should make it clear.

| PEX  | Lecture | Question |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 000 | 00 | 0 |
| 001 | 00 | 1 |
| 034 | 03 | 4 |
| 112 | 11 | 2 |

# Library

The rest of the programming exercises are in the directory named `lib` (short for library).
As the semester progresses, you'll have to implement more and more functions in the `lib` directory.
But they'll be available to use on all of your `pex`.

# Test all the things!

In the `pex/` directory, you can type `test` and it will sequentially test all
of the directories, which is a nice check on how you're doing.
