# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll implement the `mult_N_R_2`, and `pow_N_R_2` functions from `lecture/09`.
Additionally, you'll implement `mult_Z_R_2` and `pow_Z_R_2`, which work for integer arguments.


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [mult_N_R_2](+mult_N_R_2)
1. [mult_Z_R_2](+mult_Z_R_2)
1. [pow_N_R_2](+pow_N_R_2)
1. [pow_Z_R_2](+pow_Z_R_2)
