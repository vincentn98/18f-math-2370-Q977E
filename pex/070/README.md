# Abstract

In this exercise, you'll implement the various *Fibonacci* functions, first introduced in `lecture/07`.


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.

1. [fibonacci_human](+fibonacci_human)
1. [fibonacci_human_auxiliary](+fibonacci_human_auxiliary)
1. [fibonacci_matrix](+fibonacci_matrix)
1. [fibonacci_slow](+fibonacci_slow)
