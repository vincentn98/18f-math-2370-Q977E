# Abstract

You have reached the final boss of GCD. Get ready!


# Task

Descriptions of the individual tasks are in the directories with the `+` prefix.
For example, if you need to make a function named `foo` then:

1. You will need to make a file named `foo.m` which will be in **this directory** (not `+foo`).
1. Detailed instructions about that function will be in the directory `+foo`.

Here are links to the tasks.
